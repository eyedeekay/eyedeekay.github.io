Hi. This is the blog where I'm going to document all the wierd stuff I do on my
home network. I'm most passionate about the areas where I am relatively free of
constraints, and for me, that is in hobby computing in my own home. But since
it's not a place with an IT staff and other organizational resources, I
sometimes do wierd, ill-advised things to get my computers just the way I like
them.

Also I'm pretty bad at blogging.
